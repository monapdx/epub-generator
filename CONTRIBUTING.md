# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the server in dev mode: `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 and test your changes.

## Code Style
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer descriptive names and inline JSDoc comments where helpful.

## Commits & PRs
- Use clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add chapter reordering").
- Open a Pull Request early and mark it as draft if needed.
- Link related issues and add screenshots/GIFs when UI changes are involved.

## Tests
- Add unit tests when possible for pure utilities.
- Ensure manual testing coverage for the /export flow.

## Releases
- Changes that affect the EPUB format or API shape should be highlighted in the README.
